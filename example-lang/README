The "example-lang" directory contains a template for adding a language binding
to Lucy and its object model layer, Clownfish.  See the DevGuide for an
overview of Lucy's layers:

    http://incubator.apache.org/lucy/docs/perl/Lucy/Docs/DevGuide.html

The C files within "example-lang/src" contain stubs for C functions whose
interfaces are defined within "trunk/core".  These functions fill in the
missing pieces of the puzzle.  Once they are all implemented correctly, Lucy
will theoretically build and pass its tests.

Some of Lucy's classes really ought to be grouped with Clownfish, as they form
something similar to a free floating "standard library" and are not
search-related.  At some point everything under Lucy::Object will probably
migrate to a new namespace:

    Lucy::Object::Obj       => Clownfish::Obj
    Lucy::Object::CharBuf   => Clownfish::CharBuf
    Lucy::Object::VArray    => Clownfish::VArray
    Lucy::Object::Hash      => Clownfish::Hash
    Lucy::Object::BitVector => Clownfish::BitVector
    ...

Other, search-related classes belong with Lucy itself, but are represented
here because they lack one or more implementing functions:

    Lucy::Document::Doc
    Lucy::Analysis::RegexTokenizer
    Lucy::Index::Inverter
    ...
