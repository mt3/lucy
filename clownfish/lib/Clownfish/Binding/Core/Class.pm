=head1 NAME

Clownfish::Binding::Core::Class - Generate core C code for a class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clownfish::Class is an abstract specification for a class.  This module
autogenerates the C code with implements that specification.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $class_binding = Clownfish::Binding::Core::Class->new(
        client => $class,
    );

=over

=item * B<client> - A L<Clownfish::Class>.

=back

=head2 to_c_header

Return the .h file which contains autogenerated C code defining the class's
interface:  all method invocation functions, etc...

=head2 to_c

Return the .c file which contains autogenerated C code necessary for the class
to function properly.
