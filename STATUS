CURRENT RELEASE NOTES:


RELEASE BLOCKERS:

  * See the issue tracker report for the upcoming release.


TODO LIST:

  * Port the Clownfish compiler to C.
    <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCY-142>

  * Replace dependency on Parse::RecDescent within Clownfish::Parser with
    the Lemon parser generator. 
    <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCY-143>
    <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCY-134>

  * Replace dependency on JSON::XS with ???
    <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCY-133>

  * Refactor away C89 idioms, since we have chosen the intersection of C99 
    and C++ as our C dialect.
    <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCY-144>

  * Port most test files within trunk/perl/t/ to C.
    <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCY-149>

  * Scaling issues: get Lucy to perform well enough to handle search
    for ASF public mailing lists (~ 10M messages as of 2011) from a
    single host.

  * Independent build system for charmonizer. charmonizer needs to be built
    by the per-lang packaging system to create the autogen/ files.  It also
    needs to be built by the user to create the charmony.h file on the user's
    platform.  This should be accomplishable by using a "portable Makefile"
    and limiting the set of compiled objects to carefully avoid linking.

  * Tests for charmonizer need to become independent executables.  See previous
    item for more details.

WISH LIST:

  * Ruby bindings.

  * Python bindings.
