Apache Lucy
===========

OVERVIEW

Apache Lucy is a fulltext search engine library, written in C and targeted at
dynamic language users.

DISCLAIMER

Apache Lucy is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator.  Incubation is required of all
newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.  While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
ASF.

INSTALLATION

To build and install Lucy, follow the instructions in the accompanying
"INSTALL" document.
