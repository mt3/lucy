The "c" directory contains the C host language implementation of Apache Lucy.
See the DevGuide for an overview of Lucy's layers:

    http://incubator.apache.org/lucy/docs/perl/Lucy/Docs/DevGuide.html

Most of the C files within the "c/src" directory contain stubs for
routines whose interfaces are defined within "trunk/core".  

    core/src/Lucy/Index/Inverter.cfh        # Declares interface.
    core/src/Lucy/Index/Inverter.c          # all except Invert_Doc()
    example-lang/src/Lucy/Index/Inverter.c  # only Invert_Doc() 

Once all the stubs have been implemented correctly, Lucy will theoretically
build and pass its tests.

There is one pair of files with an interface *not* defined in core.

    c/src/CFBind.h
    c/src/CFBind.c

The CFBind files are there to hold conversion routines which are specific to C.
Since it is impractical to impose a generic interface, they
are not defined in core.
